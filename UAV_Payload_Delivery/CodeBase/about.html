The UCSC ECE163 UAV Modeling and Control GUI<br>

This code is provided "as is" for use in the UC Santa Cruz ECE163 Class. The code is for class use only, and not to be distributed beyond the class participants.

The GUI was written in Python 3.8.5 and pyQT5, and should provide all of the graphical interface required to complete the class. In essence, this GUI handles all of the heavy lifting in terms of drawing the vehicle in 3-space, plotting, and handling data into and out of the various modules that the students in the class will create.
<ul>
    <li>Chapter2.py - Allows the students to test their coordinate frame transformations</li>
    <li>Chapter3.py - Kinematic Simulation (object subjected to forces in a vacuum environment)</li>
    <li>Chapter4.py - Adds in Aerodynamics and Gravitational forces to the simulation</li>
    <li>Chapter5.py - Finds trim conditions and the ideal trim path for any fixed spiral</li>
    <li>Chapter6.py - Takes linearized model and closes the loop using successive loop closure</li>
</ul>

If you find bugs or flaws in this code, please send a message to the course instructors either directly via email, or post onto Piazza. We will fix them as fast as we can given the constraints of the quarter.
