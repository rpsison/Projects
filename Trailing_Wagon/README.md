I worked on the software team of the Trailing Wagon project. I was responsible for sensor fusion and integration of the robot. Used UWB sensors and combined their inputs to provide a coordinate for the control team's PID control system.


UWB Segger: 
- contains Segger Embedded Studio project files for anchor and tag ultrawideband sensors. Configures each sensor and downloads program onto DWM1001 Dev board.

UWB Main:
- contains main project code. Serial multiplexing, trilateration and coordinate calculation.

UWB Examples:
- provided examples by Decawave. Used to experiment to find the best configurations for the ultrawideband sensors.
